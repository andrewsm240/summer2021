# Monitoring Biodiversity Using Acoustic Data

## The Big Picture
Currently, the only studies of animal biodiversity examine few species at a time in small areas. Large scale studies are neither cost-effective nor time-efficient.
This greatly limits how animal biodiversity can be understood, as it is always changing.
In order to keep up with its changing nature, machine learning and artificial intelligence can be used to analyze acoustic data to determine the quantity of different species in certain areas.
Long-term analysis of [soundscapes](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/summer2021/blob/main/Macintyre/soundrecorder/campaigns/morton-arb/science_page/README.md#soundscape-ecology) will provide a baseline for animal biodiversity and how it is changing over time.

## Morton Arboretum Campaign
So where does the Morton Arboretum fit into all of this?
Before this new method for studying animal biodiversity can be deployed nationwide, it must be tested to prove that it is an effectice and feasible solution.
In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this process, six pilot sites have been selected to test this method of acoustic data analysis, and the Morton Arboretum is one of those six pilot sites.
Bioacoustic audio recording [devices](https://github.com/waggle-sensor/summer2021/tree/main/Macintyre/soundrecorder/campaigns/morton-arb/science_page#devices) have been deployed in the arboretum to collect acoustic data that will be used to understand the soundscape and biodiversity in the area.

## Soundscape Ecology
Animals make sounds for a wide variety of reasons.  They use sounds to communicate about territory, food, predators, mating, and much more.
All of these sounds contribute to what is called a soundscape.
Soundscape ecology is the branch of science that analyzes acoustic data from soundscapes to understand the relationships between biodiversity, landscapes, and anthropogenic pressures.

## Devices
### BAR-LT
![bar-lt_panel](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84532371/122977932-8ca46200-d35b-11eb-9d7d-bd94d73b785d.jpg)
The first type of device that is being used is the battery powered bioacoustic audio recorder (BAR).
These recorders can be easily fastened to trees where they blend in and constantly record audio.
### Solar BAR

The second type of device that is being used is the Solar BAR.
These recorders have the same recording capabilites as the BAR-LT, but their battery is charged by a solar panel.
If the are deployed in a place with consistent sunlight, they can record continuously for long periods of time.
