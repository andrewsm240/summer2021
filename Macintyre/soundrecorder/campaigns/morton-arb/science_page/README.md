# Monitoring Biodiversity Using Acoustic Data
## The Big Picture
Currently, the only studies of animal biodiversity examine few species at a time in small areas. Large scale studies are neither cost-effective nor time-efficient.
This greatly limits how animal biodiversity can be understood, as it is always changing.
In order to keep up with its changing nature, machine learning and artificial intelligence can be used to analyze acoustic data to determine the quantity of different species in certain areas.
