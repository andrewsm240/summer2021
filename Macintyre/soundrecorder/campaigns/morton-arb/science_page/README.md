# Monitoring Biodiversity Using Acoustic Data
## The Big Picture
Currently, the only studies of animal biodiversity examine few species at a time in small areas. Large scale studies are neither cost-effective nor time-efficient.
This greatly limits how animal biodiversity can be understood, as it is always changing.
In order to keep up with its changing nature, machine learning and artificial intelligence can be used to analyze acoustic data to determine the quantity of different species in certain areas.
## Morton Arboretum Campaign
So where does the Morton Arboretum fit into all of this?
Before this new method for studying animal biodiversity can be deployed nationwide, it must be tested to prove that it is an effectice and feasible solution.
In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this process, six pilot sites have been selected to test this method of acoustic data analysis.
