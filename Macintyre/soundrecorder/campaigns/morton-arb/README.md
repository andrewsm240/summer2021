Plan for Morton Arboretum Field Campaign

The default settings for the Frontier Labs BAR work well, but the Gain is set to 40 dB, and it can be increased to 45 dB for better results.
I have attached the schedule files for the BAR devices in summer2021/Macintyre/Campaigns, and they are called schedule_battery and schedule_solar.
All of the devices that I have with me are set up and ready to be deployed, so the next step is to determine where and when we want to deploy all of the devices.
Once I receive locations in Morton Arboretum that we want the devices to be deplyed, I will go there to check out the locations before deploying the devices.
