# Morton Arboretum Campaign

## Deployment Site

## Plan

The default settings for the Frontier Labs BAR work well, but the Gain is set to 40 dB, and it can be increased to 45 dB for better results.
I have attached the schedule files for the BAR devices in summer2021/Macintyre/Campaigns, and they are called schedule_battery and schedule_solar.
All of the devices that I have with me are set up and ready to be deployed, so the next step is to determine where and when we want to deploy all of the devices.
Once I receive locations in Morton Arboretum that we want the devices to be deplyed, I will go there to check out the locations before deploying the devices.

## Devices
### BAR-LT
The BAR-LT is a battery-powered device.  Each device has dimensions of 150 x 115 x 70 (mm) and weighs 900 grams if all 6 batteries are inside.
Straps can be used to secure the BAR-LT to trees for recording.  The microphone can be configured to connect to the bottom of the recorder or to the side.
