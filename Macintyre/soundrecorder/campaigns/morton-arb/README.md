# Morton Arboretum Campaign

## Deployment Site

## Plan

The default settings for the Frontier Labs BAR work well, but the Gain is set to 40 dB, and it can be increased to 45 dB for better results.
I have attached the schedule files for the BAR devices in summer2021/Macintyre/Campaigns, and they are called schedule_battery and schedule_solar.
All of the devices that I have with me are set up and ready to be deployed, so the next step is to determine where and when we want to deploy all of the devices.
Once I receive locations in Morton Arboretum that we want the devices to be deplyed, I will go there to check out the locations before deploying the devices.

## Devices
### BAR-LT
The BAR-LT is a battery-powered device.  Each device has dimensions of 150 x 115 x 70 (mm) and weighs 900 grams if all 6 batteries are inside.
Straps can be used to secure the BAR-LT to trees for recording.  The microphone can be configured to connect to the bottom of the recorder or to the side.
4 SD cards can be used in the device, but right now each device only has one SD card in it.
If the device is set to record 24/7 with 6 fully charged batteries and one 128 GB SD card in it, the batteries will last 29 days and the storage will fill up after 17 days.


### Solar-BAR
The Solar BAR has a built in solar panel and battery charger to 24/7 recording capabilites over long periods of time.
Each device has dimensions of 250 x 305 x 115 (mm) and weighs 4 kg (including the 12V 7.2Ah battery).
The devices can be mounted on a star picket, but they cannot be fixed to a tree in any way.
If the device is set to record 24/7 with the solar panel positioned to get consistent sunlight with a 128 GB SD card in it, the storage will fill up after 17 days.
