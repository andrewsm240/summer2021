## Week 1: 6/14–6/18
- completed onboarding forms
- attended Dr. Collis' student lecture
- explored Waggle github
- read up on LIDAR, optical flow, Sage project
- reviewed literature on LIDAR optical flow algorithms
- wrote project summary
- prepared student presentation
- [Wavelet-Based Optical Flow for Two-Component Wind Field Estimation from Single Aerosol Lidar Data](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/atot/32/10/jtech-d-15-0010_1.xml)

## Week 2: 6/21–6/25
- Monday
    - delivered, watched student presentations
    - got assignment scaffolding from Dr. Collis: started looking at ARM data, code in python, looked more into optical flow
- Tuesday
    - worked on TMS tasks/courses
    - set up Docker
    - looked into [neural networks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk), more on optical flow from reflectivity/[radar images](https://www.scitepress.org/papers/2011/33326/33326.pdf)
    - parsed zsherman Python code some more
- Wednesday
    - finished TMS tasks/courses
    - looked in to [OpenCV code](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/dee/tutorial_optical_flow.html) on optical flow
- Thursday
    - lab meeting with Dr. Collis, Dr. Ferrier, Dr. Sankaran, and rest of team
    - attended Dr. Bessac's lecture on statistical practices
    - met with Zach to go over code that generates .gif images of reflectivity data; built code to generate .png's instead
    - attended Sean's lecture on plug-ins for Waggle nodes
- Friday
    - worked on integrating [OpenCV optical flow code](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d4/dee/tutorial_optical_flow.html) into existing radar code data
          - don't understand the [cv.waitkey() code](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35372700/whats-0xff-for-in-cv2-waitkey1) // and [here](https://technicalmasterblog.wordpress.com/2019/07/03/whats-0xff-for-in-cv2-waitkey1/)
          - began generating some images with similar features (i.e., color blobs) to the ones on OpenCV
          - reviewed documentation associated with [color space conversions](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d8/d01/group__imgproc__color__conversions.html)
    - attended CELS student social
    - [Common OpenCV Methods](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/top-5-inevitable-methods-for-beginners-in-opencv-using-python-9ff8e7ddb5ae)

## Week 3: 6/28–7/2
- Monday
  - continued
