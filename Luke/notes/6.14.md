## Tasks Completed

- Sent a pull request to the `application-profiling` repo about the usage/temperature script I made 

## Notes

- Reading through research papers and resources on compiler optimization, profiling, and NVIDIA NX hardware
- Got more direction from Yongho on my role in the ECR team. I am to create a Jenkins system that will be able to automate the profiling of a Docker image (received from Yomi's interface) and run Chris's profiling program on the NX in that Docker image with the necessary profiling commands that are packaged with the image.
  - At the moment I need to be able to:
    - Run a GPU-enabled Docker container on the NX and know enough about Docker to extract some performance statistics on the container
      - Learning how `chroot` is similar but also different from a docker container
    - Understand how to create a Jenkins pipeline
