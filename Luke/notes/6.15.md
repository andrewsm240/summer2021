## Tasks Completed

- Setup Jenkins on my host desktop and the NX, debugging a socket permissions issue that had to do with user groups on the NX

## Notes

- Researching how to use Jenkins and how it can be setup on my machine as a server to manage the NX
  - I will need to create a `Jenkinsfile` to automate the profiling instances that will be run
  - A Jenkinsfile is composed with Declarative Pipeline syntax
  - I have setup a simple Pipeline instance that runs a Docker image of Python. I am not quite sure how to use Jenkins to take in as inputs a provided app Docker image and profiling arguments and have it spit out some profiling metrics.
- Researching how to run two ML models in inferencing mode at the same time
  - Docker tip: `-v [/path/on/host/machine]:[/target/mapping/folder]`
  - I will be setting up the nvidia NGC (Nvidia GPU Cloud?) on the NX so that I can easily pull ML Docker images to test multiple inferencing
    - This appears to be only for desktop Nvidia architectures, not arm64
