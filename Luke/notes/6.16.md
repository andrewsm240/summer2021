## Tasks Completed

- Attended mandatory SULI lecture

## Notes

- Trying to install Nvidia NGC catalog Docker images so that in the future they can be used to test the ML capacities of the NX. But first I need to solve a version problem with L4T that is leading to some libraries not being loaded correctly.
  - My Tegra release is 5.1 for aarch64
  - My nvidia-container-cli is 0.9.0+beta1
- Jetpack 4.5.1 (which I am running) has support for DeepStream 5.1 but not the popular demo repo examples which I was previously trying to download

- Meeting with Yongho
  - Flash NX with L4T 4.4.1
  - Pull docker plugin base 1.1.1 and login to filesystem and start development 
  - Distinguish process ID's between different plugins, find docker tool that prints stats on GPU usage
  - plugin-base-1.1.1
  - Grab PID of process that uses GPU - a good first step, don't be concerned with running plugins
