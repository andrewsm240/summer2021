## Tasks Completed

- ECR Meeting - I will need to work more heavily with Chris as both of us appear to be working on the same things. He suggested using the Tau toolset which I was able to install on the NX.

## Notes

- The Tau toolset will be able to trace and summarize CPU flow, while nvprof will be able to do the same with GPU flow. One question is whether it is useful to have fine-grained trace stats, like which functions and kernels are the most computationally expensive. It may be helpful to send some of these insights to the developers after the pipeline is finished with profiling their code. It might also be irrelevant, because PyTorch (which is running plugin code on the backend) is generating these kernels by itself, so telling the developers which kernels are inefficient won't necessary help them, because PyTorch could be the reason for their inefficiencies.
- I will need to explore how to interact with the nvvp API or whatever process reports the "application insights" at the bottom of the visual profiler.
