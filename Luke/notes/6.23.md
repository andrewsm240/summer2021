## Tasks Completed

- Met with Chris and sketched around a rough mental outline of what inputs the NX profiler would need, the mechanics of its operation, and what it would output.

## Notes

- Learning how Tau works with the goal of running it alongside Nvprof to gather CPU and GPU metrics for researchers and the real-time scheduler
  - One of the most relevant statistics that we could offer to a developer is the CPU/GPU/Memory usage of running their app at X fps. Hopefully PyTau can give us some tools to test apps so that we can put together these high-level performance stats (FPS) with low-level stats (CPU/GPU/Memory)
- Reading through presentation on "Performance Analysis of CUDA Deep Learning Networks using TAU" (https://on-demand.gputechconf.com/gtc/2017/presentation/s7684-allen-malony-performance-analysis-of-cuda-deep-learning-networks-using-tau.pdf)
  - TAU uses PAPI which is the Performance Application Programming Interface
- Meeting
  - How can we split up the workload or specialize within this project?
  - How do you know which program is interested in what metric?
  - Look at how the plugins are programmed
  - Potential problem: `nvprof` might not be able to log GPU usage as the program is running, it might only be able to output metrics after the program is complete
