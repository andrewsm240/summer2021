Hello World!

Monday, June 14: 
   - Finished my orientation 
   - Met my mentor, Neal Conrad
   - Got information on what my task was, started to look into React.js, JSON, and other javascript libraries 

Tuesday, June 15: 
   - Met with my mentor again and researched more about my heat maps and the UI. Looked at the Neon website for inspiration and thought about how I could. . 
   - improve it for Sage 
   - Did more research on heat maps and what functions 
   
Wednesday, June 16: 
   - Watched Youtube Videos to try and gain a better understanding of JSON, terminal, and InfluxDB 
   - My knowledge of terminal and JSON improved
   - went through the Sage data and tested some functions for influxDB

Thursday, June 17: 
   - Finished some paperwork for new hires 
   - Met with my mentor to discuss what I should try to focus my next research on 
   - Finished my slide and worked on my week 1 summary and presentation for Monday
   
Friday, June 18: 
   - Started a doc that had what I learned from influxDB
   - Started learning about React.js and d3.js 
   
Monday, June 21: 
   - Gave my presentation 
   - Got good feedback
      - consider the question, what happens with the data during night, when the sensors aren't gathering information (like how should the UI be formatted to accomdate for that)
      
Tuesday, June 22: 
   - Started coding
   - Looked at examples of heatmaps that are well done and have been trying to replicate
   - I have been working with other sample data instead of Sage data because it is a little difficult to access it
   
Wednedsay, June 23: 
   - Same as Tuesday: I have just been trying to replicate the heat maps 
   
Thursday, June 24: 
   - Attending Sean's tutorial on how to grab Sage data
   - Again, worked on the UI on the heat map
